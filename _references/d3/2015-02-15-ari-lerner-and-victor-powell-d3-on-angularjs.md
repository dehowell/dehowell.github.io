  title: "D3 on AngularJS"
---

A substantial chunk of _D3 on AngularJS_ is a review of just D3 on its own, but it's a pretty good survey for someone who has gotten past the basics already. The advice on integrating with AngularJS seems solid and mostly focuses on creating directives for wrapping the business of calling the D3 API, along with when to use `$apply` and `$watch` to keep D3 events integreted with updates in the AngularJS model.
