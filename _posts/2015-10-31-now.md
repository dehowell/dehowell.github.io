I'm in Vermont, splitting my time between:

- raising my son with my wife
- working as a software developer and technical lead on an [advertising platform][ads] for the auto industry
- prototyping software for art and better living as half of [Pixel to Noise][p2n]
- [reading][gr] and writing
- running
- meditating

If you want to get in touch:

- Say [hello on Twitter][tw].
- Check out my projects on [GitHub][gh].
