[Ari Lerner and Victor Powell: _D3 on AngularJS_][article]

The advice on integrating with AngularJS seems solid and mostly focuses on creating directives for wrapping the business of calling the D3 API, along with when to use `$apply` and `$watch` to keep D3 events integreted with updates in the AngularJS model.
