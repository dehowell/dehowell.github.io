The group blog _Don't Eat the Pseudoscience_ was kicked off this month by biologist Kathryn Haydon, [on the common health advice][pseudo] "Don't eat processed food!". From her perspective, it's misleading to conflate _processing_ (the steps required to make a completely raw food edible) with the addition of sugar, salt, etc. to make hyper-palatable convenience foods. Informed consumers would be better served by paying attention to the contents of the food they eat.

> As long as our diets are primarily composed of high-Calorie, low-nutrient convenience foods, we won't make meaningful steps to reduce preventable diseases.
>
> From a food scientists' perspective, the proper response is not to shun all industrially processed foods, abandoning modern life to devote yourself to food preparation. Rather, we need to rely on other criteria—Calories, macronutrient and macronutrient composition, fiber, and servings of fruits of vegetables - to choose the best whole and processed foods for healthy diets.


It's hard to gauge to what degree this is a straw-man argument. Most of the people I know take "processed food" to chips, crackers, and sweets. Avoiding that stuff is an excellent heuristic, which Haydon acknowledges.

Scott Alexander [reviewed][albion] (and summarized) David Fischer's _Albion's Seed_:

> If America is best explained as a Puritan-Quaker culture locked in a death-match with a Cavalier-Borderer culture, with all of the appeals to freedom and equality and order and justice being just so many epiphenomena – well, I’m not sure what to do with that information.

After reading the descriptions of the Puritan, Quaker, Cavalier, and Border folkways, I can't help but wonder if Neal Stephenson read _Albion's Seed_ and then that's how we got the Waterhouse / Shaftoe families of _Cryptonomicon_ and _The Baroque Cycle_.
