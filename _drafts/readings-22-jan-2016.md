[Beeminder][1] lets you put money on the line if you fail to keep pace with a goal. For example, I've committed to [maintain my publishing rate][2] here or I lose $5. Beeminder is one of the most useful tools for habit change I've ever come across. Katja Grace [puts it well on Overcoming Bias][3]:

> Compromised positions are often more desirable than extremes, and desired frequencies are unlikely to match memorable periods. So it’s a pity that vague commitments are harder to keep than firm ones. Often people don’t make commitments at all, because the readily available firm ones are too extreme. This is a big loss.

> Beeminder helps with making firm commitments to intermediate positions. Since you only ever need to notice if the slope of your data isn’t steep enough, any rate is as easy to use as a goal. You can commit to eating 40% less meat, you just have to estimate once what 40% is, then record any meat you eat. I’ve used Beeminder to journal on average five nights per week. This is better than every night or no night, but would otherwise be annoying to track.
