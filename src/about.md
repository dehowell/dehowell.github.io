David Howell is a software developer, but isn't comfortable being pigeon-holed as just a STEM-type. He did some graduate work in physics and worked on a variety of particle physics experiments, but ultimately found writing software a more congenial career path for a curious generalist&mdash;software is all about formalizing other problem domains. Besides, software engineering has its own panoply of theoretical paradigms, weird rituals, and obtuse systems to learn.


## Notable Projects

* ['in.c'][1] is a browser-based, partially automated chamber ensemble that performs Terry Riley's "In C", made in collaboration with [Jeffrey Pierce][2].
* [dehowell/ontology][3] is a library of demented Java types.
* While working at Wolfram Research, I wrote the (later open-sourced) [HadoopLink][4], a Mathematica library for working with a Hadoop cluster.
* I published my reading notes from learning the `d3.js` data visualization library as [The D3.js Annotated Bibliography][5].
* My [Codex Vitae][6] is an attempt to make my personal philosophical scaffolding explicit.
